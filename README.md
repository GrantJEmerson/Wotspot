## About
Wotspot is Hotspot without the fees. Wotspot allows any iOS device to host a session and share their mobile data. It works just like a regular hotspot, accept there is no monthly fee and all tasks are limited to the Wotspot browser. Up to 7 devices can connect to the host and use their data to surf the web.

Setting Up a Session:
- Creating a new Wotspot session is as easy as pressing "Host" on the home screen.
- Data caps allow you to keep track of the data users have consumed and limit them to a set amount.
- Once the session is set up you can continue surfing the web on the host device too.

Joining a Session:
- Joining a session is just involves accepting a host's invitation to join the session.
- Data graphs keep you up to date with the amount of data you have remaining.
- Usernames are initially set to the name of your device, but they are editable 
- Whenever you gain a signal again, you can leave the session by the tap of a button

Features:
- Night mode allows you to continue browsing late at night or in dimly lit areas
- Bookmarks allow you to store the websites you visit during the session and visit them later
- Switch between mobile and desktop mode to obtain the best browsing experience

## Running
